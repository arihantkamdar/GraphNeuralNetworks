# Project Overview

This repository, GraphNeuralNetworks, is a collection of implementations and experiments focused on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for solving graph-based machine learning problems. It includes code for training and evaluating GNN models, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), on tasks like node classification and link prediction. The project is designed for researchers and developers interested in exploring GNN applications using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric.
